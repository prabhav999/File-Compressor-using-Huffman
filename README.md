# Project Title: Huffman Coding File Compression Web Application
## Project Overview:
* This web application provides an efficient file compression and decompression service using the Huffman Coding algorithm, a widely recognized lossless data compression algorithm. The application allows users to upload text-based files, compress them for storage, and later decompress the files to retrieve the original content. The tool is designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use, offering users a seamless experience in compressing and decompressing their data.

### Features:
* File Upload & Compression:

### Users can upload text files (e.g., .txt).
* The application applies the Huffman Coding algorithm to compress the file and generate a compressed version.
### File Decompression:

* Users can upload compressed files, and the application will reconstruct the original file using the Huffman Decoding process.
### Real-Time Compression/Decompression:

* The application processes files in real-time, providing instant feedback and download options.
### Downloadable Compressed Files:

* Once the file is compressed, the application provides a downloadable link to the compressed file (in .huffman format or another custom format).
### Error Handling & Validation:

* The system checks for valid file formats and handles errors such as unsupported file types or corrupted files.
### User Interface:

* Clean, simple, and intuitive UI for users of all skill levels.
* Allows users to easily switch between compression and decompression functionalities.
### Performance:

* Efficiently handles large files and performs compression and decompression tasks with minimal latency.
### Security:

* File uploads are handled securely to ensure no malicious content can harm the system.
* Compressed files are securely processed and stored for temporary durations, ensuring privacy.
### Technologies Used:
#### Frontend:

* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React or Vue.js for dynamic rendering).
* Web-based UI for file selection, compression, and decompression actions.
#### Backend:

* Node.js/Express for handling file uploads and compression.
* Python or C++ implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm (using Python’s heapq library or C++’s priority queues).
* File management using Multer (Node.js) or another file-handling middleware.
### Compression Algorithm:

* Huffman Coding: A lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. The algorithm is implemented in Python or C++ to process file data.
### File Storage:

* Temporary file storage on the server for managing uploaded and processed files.
* Optional cloud storage integration for long-term file retention.
### Security:

* SSL encryption for secure file uploads/downloads.
* File validation to ensure safe handling of user files.
